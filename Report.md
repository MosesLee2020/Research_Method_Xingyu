# Overview<br>

This report is built based on the tutorial of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5y1XNKENbk.

**In this report, we have developed and analyzed the LC-MS/MS data set of MSV000088759, which includes three sub-files:<br>**

*MSV000088759/peak/5ugmL_Opti_NCE_stepped20-30-40_1.mzML<br>
 MSV000088759/peak/5ugmL_Opti_NCE_stepped20-30-40_2.mzML<br>
 MSV000088759/peak/5ugmL_Opti_NCE_stepped20-30-40_3.mzML<br>*


We explored the molecular networking of a special molecular cluster :**Doxorubacin** and use different Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance 
and Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance to discuss the how tolerance value affects results.

As shown in the https://github.com/MosesLee2020/Research_Method_Xingyu/blob/GNPS_(Molecular_Networking)/Job_Parameters%20in%20Case_1%20and%20Case_2.md#in-case_2-we-set-the-parameters-as-following<br>

The main difference between Case_1 and Case_2 is: *Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance* and *Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance*,
Which in Case_1 is 0.01 Da and 0.01 Da, respectively
and in Case_2 is 0.02 Da and 0.02 Da, respectively.
