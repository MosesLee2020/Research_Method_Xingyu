**Questions in the paper:**
1.	What are the detailed biogeochemical properties of the natural slicks, especially in the surface microlayer (SML)?
1.1	What is the transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) concentration in the SML of slicks and how does it differ from that in the underlying water?
1.2	What is the dissolved (DOC and DON) and particulate organic matter (POC and PON) concentration in the SML of slicks and how does it differ from that in the underlying water?
1.3	What is the nutrients concentration in the SML of slicks and how does it differ from that in the underlying water?

2.	What are the biological properties of the natural slicks, especially in the surface microlayer (SML)?
2.1	What is the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration in the SML of slicks and how does it differ from that in the underlying water?
2.2	What is the total prokaryotic and picophytoplankton cell abundances in in the SML of slicks and how does it differ from that in the underlying water?
2.3	What is the composition of bacterial communities in the SML of slicks and how does it differ from that in the underlying water?

3.	How would biogeochemical and biological properties of surface water differ between slick and non-slick area?

4.	How important is the biofilm-like properties on the sea surface in air-sea exchange?

## A formulated new scientific question:
What is the composition of bacterial communities in the sea surface microlayer of frontal slicks in the Southeastern Mediterranean Sea, and how does it differ from those in the underlying water and adjacent non-slick areas?


## A narrative paragraph with ABT framework:
The sea surface microlayer (SML) is a critical interface where complex biological, chemical, and physical processes converge, and in the Southeastern Mediterranean Sea, frontal slicks frequently form as visible accumulations that may concentrate organic, such as transparent exopolymer particles and particulate organic matter. (And) These slicks can not only act as hotspots for microbial activity, but also selectively shape bacterial communities the unique conditions within the SML, such as enhanced surfactant concentration, altered light exposure, and nutrient gradients. However (But), the composition of these communities within frontal slick SMLs, especially in relation to the underlying water column and adjacent non-slick areas, remains poorly understood in this oligotrophic region. Therefore, this study aims to characterize the bacterial community structure in the SML of frontal slicks and compare it to both the subsurface water and nearby slick-free areas, to assess how slick-associated processes influence microbial diversity and potential ecological functions at the air-sea boundary.
