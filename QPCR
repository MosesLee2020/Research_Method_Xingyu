Reserve transcription combined with the polyerase chain reaction (PCR) has been widely used as a powerful tool to quantify gene expression.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is also called real-time PCR, is a variant of the polymerase-chain-reaction in which the accumulation of amplified DNA is monitored during each cycle with a fluorescent signal.

Firstly, the RNA should be isolated and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA), which will serve as the amplification template. Secondly, the template will run through three phases of qPCR, which 
is Denaturation, Annealing and Elongation.

The ΔΔCt method is a method of qPCR to estimate the relative expression change batween a target gene and a calibrator gene.
